The file descriptive_statistics.R is used to get descriptive statistics of the data. This includes distributions of exonerees by race and state they were incarcerated in, and how often the three outcomes of interest--DNA playing a substantial role in an exoneration, false confession, and mistaken witness ID--occur. The figure in the text relating average sentence length to the presence of certain policies is also created in this file.

The file DNA_treatment_analysis.R generates all of the tables in the text related to the post conviction DNA treatment. 

The file Witness_treatment_analysis.R generates all of the tables in the text related to the witness reform treatment.

The file Interrogation_treatment_analysis.R generates all of the tables in the text related to the recording interrogations treatment.
